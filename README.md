    ```

3. **Run the Script**

    ```bash

    ```

4. **Follow the Prompts**

   - Enter the domain you want to filter (e.g., `yandex.com`) or use `*` for all domains.
   - Provide a name for the results file (e.g., `results_1.txt`).

5. **Results**

   The filtered email addresses will be saved in the specified results file.
